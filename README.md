# DFT-From-Scratch
The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a fundamental mathematical tool in digital signal processing that transforms a finite sequence of discrete time-domain samples into their corresponding frequency-domain representation. By decomposing a signal into its constituent sinusoidal components, the DFT reveals how much of each frequency is present in the original signal.

Unlike the continuous Fourier Transform, which operates on continuous signals, the DFT is designed for numerical computation and is well-suited to digital systems. Given its discrete nature, the DFT is especially useful in applications involving audio processing, image analysis, telecommunications, and more.

In this project, we implement the DFT using Python to gain a deeper understanding of its inner workings. We then apply it to a practical task: reducing noise in audio signals. By analyzing the frequency components of a noisy signal, we can identify and attenuate the undesired frequencies, thereby improving the overall audio quality.
